I came across a great list of resources for product managers by [Adam Eldarov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-eldarov-04b472b7/),
the Chief Product Officer at [YouDo](https://youdo.com/). YouDo is a Russian company, and the list is in Russian.
I believe that it is great (I have read 10 books from it so far and loved them.) and that it is worth showing it to the English-speaking audience.


The following article is the translation of Adam's text to English. I removed links to the resources that require the knowledge of Russian.
For example, the sections of "Customer Journey Map" and "UX Writing" were removed.

If you speak Russian, I recommend using the
[original article](https://www.notion.so/YouDo-Product-Skills-Track-426ef30ec1fc4a8195959dafa16710e5).

In the modern tech world, engineers work closely with product people. Hence, I recommend these books
to all engineers. It will boost skills and help to advance the career.

---------------------------

In this article, you will find resources to boost your product skills. After finishing the list, you will know the theory
at the Lead Product Manager level. It is only a theory. It complements but does not substitute practical skills.

Each section corresponds to the specific skill that is required to build successful products.

There is no particular order in which you need to choose the section, but after choosing one,
I recommend studying the material within this section in the given order.
