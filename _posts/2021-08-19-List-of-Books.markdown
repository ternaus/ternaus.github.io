Practice without theory is blind. Hence we need to supplement our practical endeavors with theoretical works. And it often comes in the form of books.

Here is a list of books I have read while working at Lyft. I do not agree with all the ideas presented in them. However, they proved to be ultra-valuable in advancing my career and shaped my current understanding of the tech industry.

How to pick which one to read? 

It is essential to say that the book's usefulness is strongly related to the reader's context.   

Typically, I practice "pain-driven prioritization," i.e., when I feel confused and do not clearly understand what is happening and what exactly I am missing, I pick books that cover the relevant topic.

**Example 1**: Reorganization happens, the director in your organization gets fired, the team gets merged with another team, and many projects, even considered "strategic," are closed. It would make sense to read something about "Career, Politics" and a story about a similar company and the challenges it faced. Say, when you work at Lyft, a book about Lyft would be great, but the book about Uber will also work.

**Example 2**: End of the year, the company starts planning for the next quarter. Everyone talks about OKRs and how important they are, but when the planning is done, and the actual work starts, people at all levels ignore half of the OKRs and do something else. => You read about OKRs, prioritization, planning, and Product managers. 

You can read the following books in any order you like, but you may consider my "pain-driven" approach as well.

If you are a product manager, I would recommend checking [the list of the books](https://ternaus.blog/books/2021/03/17/PM-track.html) by Adam Eldarov - chief product officer at YouDo. His list is excellent, although I have read only 10 books from there so far :)

It is not the complete list; it is the list that I have read so far and found insightful. There is probably another one for every book in it that talks about the same topic but much better. If you know such a better book - let me know :)
